# Appendix D (draft): the physics route to "purifiable classical process => mixture of process functions"

Status labels: **[proved]**, **[conjecture]**, **[gap]**. Nothing here proves the conjecture; it is still open.

Setting. A purification of a classical process W (diagonal; equivalently a stochastic map p(i|o) on the joint
classical inputs i and outputs o of the parties) is a unitary V : P (x) O -> F (x) I together with a fixed source
state |psi> in P such that (i) W = Tr_F of the Choi vector of V(|psi> (x) .), and (ii) for every choice of local
operations (unitaries with ancillas) the induced map P (x) ancillas -> F (x) ancillas is unitary (AFNB 2017).
Write  V|psi, o> = sum_i |i> (x) |v_{o,i}>  with  v_{o,i} in F.

**Lemma D.1 [proved].**  <v_{o',i'} | v_{o,i}> = delta_{o o'} delta_{i i'} p(i|o).
Proof. The Choi matrix of the induced channel O -> I is  sum_{o,o'} |o><o'| (x) Tr_F[ V|psi,o><psi,o'|V^dagger ],
whose ((o,i),(o',i')) entry is <v_{o',i'}|v_{o,i}>. W is diagonal with diagonal entries p(i|o). QED.
Consequence: the sink holds a perfect record of the pair (o,i): the normalised vectors f_{o,i} = v_{o,i}/sqrt(p(i|o))
(over the support of W) are orthonormal, so dim F >= |supp W| = rank W = r (the same r as in AFNB Thm 4).
Checked numerically on the source-sink lift of Lugano (code/stochastic/physics/lemma_d1_check.py).

**Lemma D.2 [proved; negative].** Conditions (i)-(ii) restricted to the source state |psi> impose nothing beyond
W being a classical process. For classical deterministic interventions with input copies, o = f(i) (+) a with the
input i copied to a private ancilla, the output for ancilla value a is sum_i |i>_anc (x) sqrt(p(i|f(i)+a)) f_{f(i)+a, i};
by D.1 these are orthogonal for a != a' and have total norm sum_i p(i|f(i)+a) = 1 (logical consistency).
Hence any non-purifiability (e.g. E_ex1, orbits 7 and 50) must come from the action of V on source states
orthogonal to |psi>. Any proof of the conjecture must use those states. This is where proposal (2) breaks down:
the "which-function" label lambda cannot come from a basis of the span of |psi> alone.

**Where proposal (2) fails [gap].** The intended argument: under each intervention the global map is a generalised
permutation conditioned on a source label lambda; expanding |psi> = sum_lambda c_lambda |lambda> gives
W = sum |c_lambda|^2 W_{w_lambda}. Three gaps:
 (a) Unitarity under local unitaries does not obviously make V, restricted to classical party inputs, a generalised
     permutation. D.1 gives orthogonality only for the fixed |psi>, and only after tracing the party wires through W.
 (b) Even when it holds for each intervention f separately, the label lambda may depend on f (no single basis of P
     works for all f). Ruling this out is exactly the noncontextuality-type step that is missing.
 (c) Coherences in |psi> across labels: they vanish from W by D.1, but they constrain V on psi-perp, see (b).

**Conjecture D.3.** If V purifies a classical process, there is an orthonormal basis {lambda} of P such that
V|lambda, o> = phase * |w_lambda(o)> (x) |g_lambda(o)> for functions w_lambda, with g_lambda injective on outputs.
D.3 implies the conjecture: each w_lambda must then be a process function, since V must stay unitary under classical
interventions restricted to the source state |lambda>, and by Baumeler-Wolf that means a unique fixed point.
D.3 holds for our source-sink lifts. It has not been tested on the non-permutation purifications found by the
optimiser (Lugano, App. C); that test is the next step. A counterexample to D.3 that is still a mixture would refute
only D.3, not the conjecture.
